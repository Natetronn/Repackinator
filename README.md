# Repackinator

This tool processes zip/7z/iso removing video partition, adding a modern attach.xbe complete with icon extracted from the iso's default.xbe

This icon extraction has been tested against a huge collection of games and is able to extract all icons including ones that were previously not able to by other scripts.

This is just a initial relase and feedback / ideas are welcome.
